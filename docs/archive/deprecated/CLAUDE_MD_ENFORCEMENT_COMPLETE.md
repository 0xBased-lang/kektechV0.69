2. Follow QUICK_START guide
3. Update validation checklist
4. Cannot proceed without completion
```

### 3. Validation Gates

## 🎯 WHY YOU CANNOT DEVIATE NOW

### 1. Documentation Lock-In
Every document references the others, creating a web of accountability:
```
CLAUDE.md
  ↓ references
FINAL_BULLETPROOF_DEPLOYMENT_MASTER_PLAN.md
  ↓ requires
DUAL_TESTING_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md
  ↓ tracks with
DEPLOYMENT_TODO_CHECKLIST.md
  ↓ implements
QUICK_START_DUAL_TESTING.md
  ↓ validates back to
CLAUDE.md
```

### 2. Daily Task Tracking
- 147 specific tasks to check off
- Cannot skip tasks (dependencies)
- Daily progress visible
- Issues must be documented

### 3. Multiple Validation Points
- End of each day
- End of each week
- Before each phase
- Before mainnet
- After deployment

### 4. Clear Success Criteria
```
Must achieve:
✅ 0 security issues
✅ 218 tests passing
✅ <100k gas per bet
✅ Fork/Sepolia match
✅ Beta success
✅ 24hr stability
```
