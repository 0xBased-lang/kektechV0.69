2. **Custom YUL is Risky**
   - Smaller contracts ✅
   - But verification fails ❌
   - Not worth the trade-off

3. **Fork Testing is Essential**
   - Found 4 critical bugs for $0
   - Validated deployment scripts
   - Prevented expensive Sepolia failures

4. **100% is Achievable**
   - Don't accept "good enough"
   - Keep experimenting
