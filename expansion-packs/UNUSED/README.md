# Unused Expansion Packs

These expansion packs were moved here during repository cleanup on $(date +%Y-%m-%d).

## Why These Were Moved

These packs contain only template/placeholder files with no actual implementation:
- bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev (4 files, 0 code)
- bmad-2d-unity-game-dev (5 files, 0 code)
- bmad-creative-writing (11 files, 0 code)
- bmad-godot-game-dev (11 files, 0 code)
- bmad-infrastructure-devops (1 file, 0 code)

## Kept Active

- **bmad-blockchain-dev** (23,094 files, 14,178 code files) - ACTIVELY USED

## Restoring

If you need any of these packs back:
\`\`\`bash
mv expansion-packs/UNUSED/[pack-name] expansion-packs/
\`\`\`

## Deletion

If you're certain you don't need these, you can safely delete:
\`\`\`bash
rm -rf expansion-packs/UNUSED/
\`\`\`
