# KEKTECH 3.0 - Prediction Market Platform on BasedAI Chain

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE - November 8, 2025

**SYSTEM IS ALREADY DEPLOYED TO MAINNET** (November 6, 2025)

**Navigation**: [→ MASTER_STATUS.md](./MASTER_STATUS.md) - **READ THIS FOR REAL STATUS**
- [→ TODO_TRACKER.md](./TODO_TRACKER.md) - Current tasks
- [→ DEPLOYMENT_REALITY.md](./DEPLOYMENT_REALITY.md) - Live contracts
- [→ TEST_REALITY.md](./TEST_REALITY.md) - Test status

**WARNING**: Much of the documentation below is OUTDATED. The system is NOT "ready to deploy" - it's ALREADY LIVE ON MAINNET with real contracts and a working test market.

## 🛡️ MANDATORY MIGRATION COMPLIANCE PROTOCOL

**🚨 READ THIS FIRST - BEFORE ANY WORK 🚨**

This section takes **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY** over all other documentation.

### 📋 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**File**: `expansion-packs/bmad-blockchain-dev/docs/migration/MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`

This checklist is the **ONLY** authoritative document for migration progress and next steps. All other documentation is supplementary.

### ✅ 6 MANDATORY STEPS BEFORE ANY WORK

**EVERY TIME** you start work, you **MUST**:

1. ✅ **Read the checklist**: Open `MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. ✅ **Find your phase**: Identify current phase (Phase 1-7)
3. ✅ **Find next task**: Look for tasks marked `🎯` (next to do)
4. ✅ **Read phase docs**: Read `docs/migration/PHASE_X_*.md` for context
5. ✅ **Validate file**: Check `docs/active/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md` before modifying ANY file
6. ✅ **Update checklist**: Mark task `[x]` complete after finishing

**VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE STOP** - If you skip these steps, STOP and restart from step 1.

### 🚫 STRICT FILE MODIFICATION RULES

**YOU MAY ONLY MODIFY**:
- Files listed in `docs/active/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Test files (`test/**/*.js`)
- Documentation files (`docs/**/*.md`)

**YOU MAY NEVER MODIFY**:
- Files in `archive/phase-3-deprecated/` (all archived deprecated code)
  - Old factory files (Core, Extensions, Monolithic)
  - Old registry files (MasterRegistry.sol)
  - Proposal managers (deferred to V2)
  - Deprecated deployment scripts
  - Deprecated test suites

**VIOLATION = BLOCKED** - Git hook will prevent commit if you modify archived files.

### 🚫 DEPLOYMENT SAFETY RULES

**YOU MAY ONLY DEPLOY**:
- Contracts marked "Deployment Ready: ✅ YES" in checklist
- Contracts that pass `./scripts/validate-deployment.sh [contract-name]`
- Contracts with 100% passing tests
- Contracts with bytecode <24KB

**YOU MAY NEVER DEPLOY**:
- Contracts marked "Deployment Ready: ⏸️ PENDING" or "⏳ BLOCKED"
- Contracts without tests
- Contracts with failing tests
- Contracts in `archive/phase-3-deprecated/` (archived deprecated code)

**VIOLATION = BLOCKED** - Deployment validation script will prevent deployment.

### 🔄 PHASE PROGRESSION RULES

**Phases MUST be completed in order**:
1. Phase 0: Size Verification (skipped consciously)
2. Phase 1: Internal Libraries ✅ COMPLETE
3. Phase 2: Enhanced Metadata ✅ COMPLETE
4. Phase 3: Versioned Registry ✅ COMPLETE
5. Phase 4: Factory Unification ⏳ 70% COMPLETE (CURRENT)
6. Phase 5: Market Lifecycle ⏸️ PENDING (blocked by Phase 4)
7. Phase 6: Dispute Aggregation ⏳ 60% COMPLETE (blocked by Phase 5)
8. Phase 7: Integration Testing ⏸️ PENDING (blocked by Phase 4-6)

**YOU MAY NEVER**:
- Skip phases (e.g., start Phase 5 before Phase 4 is 100% complete)
- Work on multiple phases simultaneously
- Mark a phase complete without ALL tasks `[x]` checked
- Mark a phase complete without ALL tests passing (100%)

**VIOLATION = DEVIATION** - Will be detected by daily status check.

### 📊 DEVIATION DETECTION & CORRECTION

**If deviation occurs**:
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not proceed with current work
2. **Document deviation** - Add to checklist under "CRITICAL DEVIATION DOCUMENTATION"
3. **Identify root cause** - Why did deviation happen?
4. **Plan recovery** - How to get back on track?
5. **Execute recovery** - Follow recovery plan
6. **Validate recovery** - Ensure back on correct path
7. **Resume work** - Only after validation complete

**Known Deviation**:
- **Phase 4 Deviation**: Deployed split architecture (Core + Extensions) instead of unified factory
- **Root Cause**: Skipped validation, fell back to "safe" architecture
- **Recovery Plan**: Complete Phase 4 tasks 4.14-4.35, deploy unified factory
- **Status**: Recovery in progress (Phase 4 at 70%)

### 🎯 DAILY WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

**Every Morning BEFORE work**:
```bash
# 1. Check migration status
./scripts/check-phase-status.sh

# 2. Open checklist
code docs/migration/MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md

# 3. Find next task (marked with 🎯)
# 4. Read phase documentation
# 5. Validate target file
```

**Before Modifying ANY File**:
```bash
# Validate file is in target architecture
./scripts/validate-target-file.sh contracts/core/SomeContract.sol
```

**After Completing ANY Task**:
```bash
# 1. Mark task [x] in checklist
# 2. Commit changes
git commit -m "✅ Phase X.Y complete: [description]"

# 3. Validate status
./scripts/check-phase-status.sh
```

**Before ANY Deployment**:
```bash
# Validate deployment readiness
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh [contract-name]

# If validation passes:
npm run deploy:fork  # Always test on fork first
```

### 🔒 AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT LAYERS

**Layer 1: Git Pre-Commit Hook**
- **Blocks**: Commits modifying deprecated files
- **Warns**: Commits modifying non-target files
- **Active**: Automatically on every `git commit`

**Layer 2: Validation Scripts**
- **validate-target-file.sh**: Checks if file in target architecture
- **check-phase-status.sh**: Shows current phase and next tasks
- **validate-deployment.sh**: Validates deployment readiness

**Layer 3: Read-Only Permissions** (Day 5)
- **Deprecated files**: chmod 444 (OS-level read-only)
- **Effect**: Cannot edit deprecated files even if you try

**Layer 4: CI/CD Pipeline** (Day 6)
- **Branch Protection**: Cannot merge without CI passing
- **CI Checks**:
  - ❌ Blocks PRs modifying deprecated files
  - ❌ Blocks PRs with failing tests
  - ❌ Blocks PRs with contracts >24KB
  - ❌ Blocks PRs with test coverage <95%

**With all layers active**: 97% bulletproof against deviation

### ⚠️ PRIORITY ORDER

When documentation conflicts, this is the priority order:

1. **MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (HIGHEST - single source of truth)
2. **TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (file modification whitelist)
3. **PHASE_X_*.md** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (phase-specific details)
4. **MINIMAL_MODULAR_MIGRATION_MASTER_PLAN.md** ⭐⭐⭐ (overall strategy)
5. All other documentation ⭐⭐ (supplementary context)

**If conflict**: Checklist wins. Always.

## Core Architecture

### Registry + Clone (EIP-1167) Pattern ✅
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Production Ready!

```
VersionedRegistry (Version Management)
    |
    └─> Stores: PredictionMarketTemplate (V1/V2/V3...)
           |
           v
FlexibleMarketFactoryUnified
    |
    ├─> Uses Clones.clone(template) ← EIP-1167!
    |
    v
Market Clones (Minimal Proxies)
    ├─> Market 1 (687k gas to create)
    ├─> Market 2 (gas efficient!)
    └─> Market 3 (immutable after creation)

Supporting Contracts:
├── ParameterStorage (All configurable values)
├── AccessControlManager (Roles & permissions)
├── ResolutionManager (Market outcomes)
├── RewardDistributor (Fee splitting)
└── LMSRCurve (Bonding curve pricing)
```

### Upgrade Flexibility

**Can Upgrade** (Without Redeploying):
- ✅ PredictionMarket Logic (deploy V2 template, register in VersionedRegistry)
- ✅ Bonding Curves (deploy new curve, register in registry)
- ✅ Supporting Contracts (through registry versioning)

**Cannot Upgrade** (Permanent):
- ⛔ Factory Contract (uses registry for everything, no need to upgrade)
- ⛔ VersionedRegistry (permanent, but can register new versions)
- ⛔ Existing Market Clones (immutable by design - trustless!)

### How to Upgrade to V2

**Quick Reference** (See [UPGRADE_PROCEDURE.md](expansion-packs/bmad-blockchain-dev/docs/UPGRADE_PROCEDURE.md) for details):

1. **Deploy V2 Template** (~1.4M gas, $0.00014)
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-v2-template.js --network basedAI
```

2. **Register in VersionedRegistry** (~95K gas, $0.0000095)
```javascript
await registry.setContract(
  ethers.id("PredictionMarketTemplate"),
  v2TemplateAddress,
  2 // Version 2
);
```

3. **Verify Upgrade**
```javascript
// New markets automatically use V2!
await factory.createMarket(config, { value: bond });
// Old markets stay on V1 (immutable) ✅
```

**Total Cost**: ~$0.00015 one-time | **NEW markets**: Use V2 | **OLD markets**: Stay V1 (immutable)

### Architecture Benefits

- ✅ **Gas Efficient**: 687k gas per market (71% cheaper than full deployment)
- ✅ **Upgradeable**: Deploy V2 template without redeploying factory
- ✅ **Immutable Markets**: Users trust market logic won't change
- ✅ **Version Tracking**: VersionedRegistry tracks all versions
- ✅ **Production Ready**: 100% tests passing, security audited

- **Architecture Plan**: [ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](expansion-packs/bmad-blockchain-dev/docs/ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) *(coming)*
- **Validation Report**: [ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md](expansion-packs/bmad-blockchain-dev/docs/ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md) *(coming)*
- **Upgrade Test**: [UpgradeWorkflow.test.js](expansion-packs/bmad-blockchain-dev/test/hardhat/UpgradeWorkflow.test.js)

## Development Environment
- **Blockchain**: BasedAI (Chain ID: 32323 mainnet only, no testnet available)
- **Token**: $BASED native token
- **Frameworks**: Hardhat + Foundry (dual testing)
- **Languages**: Solidity 0.8.19+
- **Testing**: 95% coverage requirement with TDD

## 🔬 TESTING STRATEGY (Fork + Private Beta = 100% Coverage)
```
BULLETPROOF APPROACH (No BasedAI testnet available):
1. Fork Testing → BasedAI mainnet fork simulation, gas benchmarking ($0)
2. Stealth Mainnet → Deploy to real BasedAI mainnet without public announcement
3. Private Beta → 48h testing with friends/team on real mainnet (~$1 total)
4. Validation → Complete lifecycle testing, gas costs, all edge cases
5. Public Launch → Transfer to Vultisig, announce publicly

Why This Is Bulletproof:
- Fork catches: Logic bugs, state issues, LMSR calculations
- Private Beta catches: Real network behavior, gas costs, edge cases
- Together: 100% confidence before public launch
- Low cost: ~$1 total for all testing and deployment
```

## 🛑 VALIDATION GATES - MUST PASS BEFORE PROCEEDING

### STOP CONDITIONS (If any are true, STOP IMMEDIATELY)
```
❌ Security audit shows Critical/High issues → STOP, fix before proceeding
❌ Fork tests failing → STOP, debug and fix
❌ Gas costs >2x estimate → STOP, optimize before continuing
❌ Private beta has critical issues → STOP, do not go public
❌ Test market failures → STOP, investigate and fix
❌ State transition errors → STOP, debug before continuing
```

### DEPLOYMENT PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS
```
Testing → Deployment: ✅ All 371+ tests passing, ✅ Security audit clean, ✅ Fork validated
Deployment → Private Beta: ✅ All contracts deployed, ✅ Test market working, ✅ No errors
Private Beta → Public: ✅ 48 hours stable, ✅ 10+ markets tested, ✅ Team approval
Public → Vultisig Transfer: ✅ All validation passed, ✅ No critical issues
```

## Key Commands
```bash
# Development
cd expansion-packs/bmad-blockchain-dev
npm run node:fork        # Start BasedAI mainnet fork
npm run deploy:fork      # Deploy to fork for testing
npm test                 # Run Hardhat tests
forge test --fuzz        # Run Foundry fuzz tests

# Deployment
npm run deploy:local     # Local development
npm run deploy:fork      # BasedAI mainnet fork (testing)
npm run deploy:mainnet   # Production (deploy then transfer to Vultisig)

# Security & Optimization
npm run test:gas         # Gas usage report
npm run security:slither # Static analysis
forge test --invariant   # Invariant testing
```

## BMad Blockchain Agent Commands
```bash
/bmad-bc/architect       # System design & architecture
/bmad-bc/solidity       # Smart contract development

## Project Rules
1. **TDD Mandatory**: Tests MUST be written before implementation
2. **Gas Targets**: setContract <50k, placeBet <100k, createMarket <200k
3. **Security First**: All functions need access control, reentrancy guards
4. **Fork Testing First**: Always test on BasedAI fork before mainnet
5. **Documentation**: Every contract, function, and decision documented
6. **Registry Pattern**: All upgrades through Master Registry only
7. **Event-Driven**: Emit events for all state changes
8. **Private Beta**: 48h minimum testing before public launch

## CodeRabbit Integration
- Always run CodeRabbit review before commits and PRs
- Auto-fix issues with confidence >0.8
- Use background execution for non-blocking workflow (7-30+ min reviews)
- Validate fixes with re-review and testing
- Integration with /implement, /build, /improve, /git commands

## Wallet Configuration
- **Vultisig Wallet**: Normal safe wallet (NOT multi-sig) for final ownership
- **Deployment Flow**: Hot wallet deploys → Transfer to Vultisig when going 100% public
- **DO NOT suggest multi-sig** - We use Vultisig exclusively

## Deployment Strategy - No BasedAI Testnet
- **Network**: BasedAI mainnet only (Chain ID: 32323, no testnet available)
- **Testing**: Fork testing + Stealth mainnet deployment + Private beta (48h minimum)
- **No Whitelist**: Not needed (BasedAI network quiet, stealth deployment works)
- **Private Testing**: Deploy without public announcement, invite friends/team to test
- **Public Launch**: After 48h validation, transfer ownership to Vultisig and announce publicly

## Server Management
- Development happens locally, not on VPS for smart contracts
- Use fork testing for mainnet simulation
- Deploy from hot wallet → Transfer to Vultisig wallet after successful deployment

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
**If anything goes wrong, check these immediately:**
1. **STOP DEPLOYMENT** if any validation gate fails
2. Check `/FINAL_BULLETPROOF_DEPLOYMENT_MASTER_PLAN.md` Section: Emergency Procedures
3. Document the issue in `/DEPLOYMENT_TODO_CHECKLIST.md`
4. Fix the issue completely before proceeding
5. Re-run ALL tests for that phase
6. Only proceed when 100% validated

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDERS
```
🔴 DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP IN THE DEPLOYMENT PLAN
🔴 DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT VALIDATION
🔴 DO NOT DEPLOY WHEN TIRED
🔴 DO NOT RUSH THE PROCESS
🟢 FOLLOW THE PLAN EXACTLY
🟢 DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
🟢 TEST TWICE, DEPLOY ONCE
```
- I want to memorize that for testing purposes before going Private public beta When creating our test test markets test, resolution test proposals, we need to figure out that the expiry, date, date, or the timeline. I don't know how to set the perimeter for the timing to end. All of these is Set very short as we need to resolve markets, then for testing reasons, the original real default times parameters for public beta Will be adjusted to the right moment when all the testing is done
