# Legacy Monorepo Assets

This directory contains the historical documentation, scripts, and configuration
files from the previous npm workspace/monorepo layout. The active frontend Next.js
application now lives at the repository root, and the Solidity contracts were
moved to `contracts/`. Keep these files for reference only—new development should
happen in the root frontend or the `contracts` folder.
